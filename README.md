# Lab: Using Operators and Design Construct with Dynamic E-commerce Order Processor

# Objective:
Develop an interactive Java application that simulates a complex order processing system. Your program will prompt the user for order details, then dynamically calculate the order total, apply discounts/surcharges, determine shipping costs, and demonstrate string equality based on user input. This lab tests your ability to handle user input, apply core Java SE 8 concepts including operators, control flow statements (if-else, ternary, switch-case), and string equality.
# Key Concepts Applied:
* User Input: Using java.util.Scanner to read various data types.
* Arithmetic, Relational, and Logical Operators (and their precedence)
* if-else and if-else if-else conditional statements
* Ternary Operator (? :)
* switch-case statements
* String equality (.equals(), .equalsIgnoreCase(), and ==)
